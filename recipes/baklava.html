            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>

            <li>9x13 Pan</li>
        </uo>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Baklava</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly grease a 9x13 pan and set the oven to 350°F.</li>
            <li>Thaw the phyllo dough according to manufacturer's directions 
                (this may take overnight). When thawed, roll out the dough and 
                cut the dough in half so the sheets will fit in the pan. Cover 
                with a damp towel to keep it from drying out.</li>
            <li>Process the nuts untl in small, even sized pieces. Combine with
                sugar, cinnamon, and cloves. In a separate bowl, melt the butter
                in the microwave.</li>
            <li>Place a sheet of phyllo dough into the pan. Using a pastry brush, 
                brush the phyllo sheet with melted butter. Repeat 7 more times 
                until it is 8 sheets thick, each sheet being "painted" with the butter.</li>
            <li>Spoon on a thin layer of the nut mixture. Cover with two more sheets of phyllo, 
                brushing each one with butter. Continue to repeat the nut mixture and two buttered 
                sheets of phyllo until the nut mixture is all used up. The top layer should be 8 phyllo 
                sheets thick, each sheet being individually buttered. Do not worry if the sheets crinkle 
                up a bit, it will just add more texture.</li>
            <li>Cut into 24 equal sized squares using a sharp knife. Bake at 350°F for 30-35 minutes or 
                until lightly golden brown, and edges appear slightly crisp.</li>
        <h3>Syrup</h3>
            <li>Combine the cinnamon stick, sugar, lemon juice, honey, and water in a saucepan.
                Bring to a boil, then reduce to medium low heat and let simmer for 7 minutes and 
                slightly thickened. Remove the cinnamon stick and allow to cool.</li>
        <h3>Finishing Touches</h3>
                <li>Spoon the cooled syrup over the hot baklava and let cool for at least 4 hours. Garnish with
                    some finely crusted pistachios of desired.</li>
        </ol>
